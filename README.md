Learning to trace: Expressive line drawing generation from photographs.

The authors present a method for automatically tracing high‐resolution photographs to create expressive line drawings. Given a photograph, an algorithm extracts expressive edges and creates a clean line drawing using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
  
As the datasets mentioned in the paper are not public, I've rearranged and used another dataset BIPED introduced in
